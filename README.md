### PROJECT TITLE: Food Drive Optimization

Welcome to the repository for our Capstone project at Norquest College. This project aims to improve the efficiency of drop-off and pick-up processes and optimize resource allocation for a more effective food drive campaign.

### Problem Statement

The current food donation management system in Edmonton faces challenges in coordinating drop-off locations, pick-up processes, and route planning. There is a need to automate and optimize these processes to ensure the timely collection of donations and minimize logistical complexities.

### Solution

Proposed Solution & Models used

### Repository Structure

The repository contains the following files:

* FoodDrive_demo_main.py: This file is being pulled by streamlit and is the main code of the app.
* combined_data.csv: This is the dataset being used for EDA and pulling dropdown values from, and it contains the collected and formatted food drive data
* random_forest_classifier_model.pkl: This is a train random forest model that predicts if a given route will take more than 1 hour to complete.
* requirements.txt: Contains a list of required packages to be installed to properly run the main file.
* Logo.png: NorQuest College Logo displayed within the app.
