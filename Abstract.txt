The Edmonton Food Drive Project is focused on utilizing machine learning to optimize food donation management. It aims to improve the efficiency of drop-off and pick-up processes, enhance route planning, and optimize resource allocation for a more effective food drive campaign.

    Lessons learned:
    - No standardized processes for volunteers doing Bag Collection
      - Volunteers had varying amounts of information about their routes
      - Volunteers were mostly estimating the bags collected, doors in route, and time taken
    - Missing key data collection fields
      - Route number not being collected caused the specificity of the data to be reduced
    - Given digital route information (as provided by the Londonderry Chapel) allows for deeper analysis into which routes/areas will yield the most bags.
